# Wi-Fi_strength in dBm 

## Concept
Signal strength reading in dBm displayed on the Status screen of an Android phone. At -107 dBm, that’s a pretty weak signal.

Of course all phones have the “bars” graphic that displays Wi-Fi signal Strength. The problem with the ubiquitous bars representation is that there are no standards. The accuracy of the bars graphic can vary widely between phone models, devices from different manufacturers, and operating systems.
Viewing your phone’s actual signal strength reading is always preferable to relying on the bars graphic. My phone’s 3 bars may well represent a stronger signal than your phone’s 4 bars.
